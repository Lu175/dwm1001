# DWM1001

The purpose of this project is to get the DWM1001 module up and running.

So far, a simple breakout board has been made for the module and the files for that are available here.

Any code written for bringing the devices up will also detailed here.  The initial intent is to use the preloaded firmware on the module and to conduct simple ranging.

More to come!
